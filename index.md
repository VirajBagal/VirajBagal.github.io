I am a research intern working under the joint supervision of [Dr. C.V. Jawahar](https://www.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/) and [Dr. Gaurav Sharma](http://www.grvsharma.com) at the [Center for Visual Information Technology](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/) (CVIT), [IIIT-Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in) since July 2016. Before moving to Hyderabad, I was a Software Engineer at [Media.net](http://www.media.net/) in Mumbai. Prior to that, I completed my dual degree (B. Tech + M. Tech) in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIT Roorkee](http://www.iitr.ac.in/) in 2015 where I worked with [Dr. R. Balasubramanian](http://www.iitr.ac.in/departments/CSE/pages/Home+Departments_and_Centres+Mathematics+People+Faculty+Balasubramanian_R_.html) and [Dr. Debashis Sen](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/fac-profiles/showprofile.php?empcode=SWmUW&depts_name=ec) on expression recognition from facial images. Over the course of my undergrad, I spent 3 wonderful summers at Google India, Media.net and Cadence Design Systems working on projects ranging from Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing to building web-based products.

Currently, I am working on applying deep learning techniques to solve the semantic face recognition/retrieval problem in unconstrained, large-scale settings. Broadly speaking, my area of interests lie at the intersection of Deep Learning, Computer Vision  and Machine Learning.
